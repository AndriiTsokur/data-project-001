# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. We're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and our job is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.

At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.

In this project I passed through a complete data science workflow:

- Started by clarifying the goal of our project.
- Collected relevant data.
- Cleaned the data to prepare it for analysis.
- Analyzed the cleaned data.

Tools:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
